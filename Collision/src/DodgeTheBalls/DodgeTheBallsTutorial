Welcome to Dodge the Balls!

Your goal is to eat as many colored balls
as you can with your mouse. Each colored 
ball you eat will give you a point.
If you hit a black ball- you die.

Bonus balls:
White ball- removes all blacks. 

Green ball- eats every ball in a small radius,
you get a point for each ball you each no matter
what color. If you eat a bonus ball with a green ball
the other balls's bonus won't activate.

Red ball- is worth five points.
